# SE-UML-Project-E-Ticketing
UML modeling and system design of an E-Ticketing System with complete documentation.
# E-Ticketing System â€“ UML Project

This repository contains the UML analysis and design of an E-Ticketing System developed as part of a Software Engineering project. The system enables users to search, book, and manage tickets online through a structured software design modeled using Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.

---

## Project Overview
The E-Ticketing System is designed to simplify the process of ticket booking by providing an online platform where users can search for available tickets, make payments, and download e-tickets. The administrator manages ticket details, schedules, routes, and user information.

## Objectives
- To analyze and design an E-Ticketing System using UML methodology.
- To model both the structural and behavioral aspects of the system.
- To document system requirements clearly through diagrams and descriptions.
- To demonstrate the importance of software modeling in real-time applications.
